Carbonation
===========

There are two main ways you can go about carbonating your homebrew: **priming** sugar and **force carbonation**. ¹_

Priming
-------

The amount of carbonation in bottle-conditioned homebrew is dependent on two things — the residual level of carbon dioxide after fermentation and the amount of carbonation obtained from the priming sugar. ²_

To know how much sugar to add in you beer use a Beer Priming Calculator_.
